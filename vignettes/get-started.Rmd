In this article, we're going to show you how to pre-process your microdata and control tables using the {PopulationSynthesiser} package, then use the `mlfit` package generate synthetic population data.
We'll use the Australian Census 2016 data as an example. 
After we have generated the synthetic population, we'll use the `postfit_*` functions to convert the synthetic population into a format that can be used by [ActivityGenerator](https://aurin-office.github.io/RCITI_ActivityGenerator/).
We refer to this format the 'CVISTA' format, which stands for 'Close-enough to VISTA'.

## Before we get started!

In the following example, we will be using a few other R packages wasn't shipped with your R program, they provide useful functions for transforming and visualising data. So make sure you have installed all these following packages using `install.packages("<packge-name>")`.

- `dplyr` for summarising data in a data.frame.
- `sf` for working with spatial data.
- `mapview` for plotting spatial data.

and of course we will need this package, `PopulationSynthesiser` as well. However, installing this is a bit different as the package is not yet officially on CRAN. Please follow the 'Installation' section on the README page to install the package. 


## Loading the datasets into R

We should now have 2 person control tables, 1 household control table, and 1 microdata. Let's import all of them into R. We can use these functions to read them into R. Notice that, in `read_census_microdata()` you have to state the `census_year` of your microdata and the names of the columns that you would like to select in `select`. `census_year` helps the package to correctly identify the geographical boundary variables in the microdata. `select` is optional, but when stated it can help to reduce the time it takes to import the microdata.

``` r
library(PopulationSynthesiser)
microdata <-
  read_census_microdata(
    person_file = "datasets/Census2016_CSV/BCSF16_person_new.csv",
    family_file = "datasets/Census2016_CSV/BCSF16_family.csv",
    dwelling_file = "datasets/Census2016_CSV/BCSF16_dwelling.csv",
    census_year = "2016",
    select = c("regucp", "agep", "mstp", "sexp", "nprd", "occp", "rlhp")
  ) %>%
  create_fitting_sample()

person_control_1 <-
  read_census_tablebuilder("datasets/person_control_1.csv") %>%
  create_fitting_control()

person_control_2 <-
  read_census_tablebuilder("datasets/person_control_2.csv") %>%
  create_fitting_control()

household_control_1 <-
  read_census_tablebuilder("datasets/household_control_1.csv") %>%
  create_fitting_control()
```

```{r, include = FALSE, eval = FALSE}
library(PopulationSynthesiser)
microdata <-
  read_census_microdata(
    person_file = "inst/testdata/confidential/Census2016_CSV/BCSF16_person_new.csv",
    family_file = "inst/testdata/confidential/Census2016_CSV/BCSF16_family.csv",
    dwelling_file = "inst/testdata/confidential/Census2016_CSV/BCSF16_dwelling.csv",
    census_year = "2016",
    select = c("regucp", "agep", "mstp", "sexp", "nprd", "occp", "rlhp")
  ) %>%
  create_fitting_sample()

person_control_1 <-
  read_census_tablebuilder("inst/testdata/2016-nsw-sa2-ur-sex-mstp.csv") %>%
  create_fitting_control()

person_control_2 <-
  read_census_tablebuilder("inst/testdata/2016-nsw-sa2-ur-occp.csv") %>%
  create_fitting_control()

household_control_1 <-
  read_census_tablebuilder("inst/testdata/2016-nsw-sa2-dwelling-nprd.csv") %>%
  create_fitting_control()
```

```{r, eval = FALSE, include = FALSE} 
randwick_north_sa2_code_2016 <- "118021569"
person_control_1 <- person_control_1[sa2 == randwick_north_sa2_code_2016]
person_control_2 <- person_control_2[sa2 == randwick_north_sa2_code_2016]
household_control_1 <- household_control_1[sa2 == randwick_north_sa2_code_2016]
```

Here are the datasets that we have just loaded into R. Note that, we are not printing out the microdata as is because no ABS microdata should never be shared in its raw form^[https://www.abs.gov.au/ausstats/abs@.nsf/Lookup/by%20Subject/1406.0.55.003~User%20Guide~Main%20Features~Using%20microdata%20responsibly~25].

## Synthesise the population

We are now going to create fitting problems, one for each zone. This will help us to sample only the records in the microdata that geographically match our control totals' zones. 

For example, if our microdata contains people from four different zones as shown in the image below. 

![](../man/figures/fitting_problem-sampling-1.png)

But our fitting problem is only for a zone (the orange patch) in one of those regions. In this case, each fitting problem will only sample people from the region that contains the zone to be in the reference sample of the fitting problem.

![](../man/figures/fitting_problem-sampling-2.png)

```r
library(mlfit)

geo_hierarchy <- csf_geo2016()

head(geo_hierarchy)
#>    regucp       sa2
#> 1:      1 101021007
#> 2:      1 101021008
#> 3:      1 101021009
#> 4:      1 101021010
#> 5:      1 101021011
#> 6:      1 101021012

fitting_problems <- ml_problem(
  ref_sample = microdata,
  field_names = special_field_names(
    groupId = "abshid", individualId = "abspid", count = "count",
    zone = "sa2", region = "regucp"
  ),
  group_controls = list(household_control_1),
  individual_controls = list(person_control_1, person_control_2),
  geo_hierarchy = geo_hierarchy
)
#> Creating a list of fitting problems by zone

ml_problem <- fitting_problems[["118021569"]] %>%
  prefit_csf_agep_to_age5p()
```

To solve our fitting problem we can use `ml_fit()` from the `mlfit` package. This package provides 4 different multi-level fitting algorithms: `r paste(PopulationSynthesiser:::.fitting_algorithms, collapse = ", ")`. See `?mlfit::ml_fit` to learn more about the algorithms. Here we are going to use the famous Iterative Proportion Updating algorithm (`ipu`) to solve our fitting problem.

Although, the algorithm did not reach a convergence for this fitting problem, but the errors are quite small. Priting out `fitting_result` to console provides some useful results of your fitting problem.

```r
fitting_result <- mlfit::ml_fit(algorithm = "ipu", ml_problem)
fitting_result
#> An object of class ml_fit
#>   Algorithm: ipu
#>   Success: FALSE
#>   Residuals (absolute): min = -0.02301994, max = 2.829837
#>   Flat problem:
#>   An object of class flat_ml_fit_problem
#>     Dimensions: 30 groups, 1192 target values
#>     Model matrix type: separate
#>     Original fitting problem:
#>     An object of class ml_problem
#>       Reference sample: 2639 observations
#>       Control totals: 2 at individual, and 1 at group level
#>       Zone: 118021569
```

Now let's replicate each record in the reference sample by its fitted/calibrated weights. You can use `mlfit::ml_replicate()` to do that. Lookup `?mlfit::ml_replicate` to see the definitions of its arguments.

```r
full_population <-
  ml_replicate(fitting_result, algorithm = "trs")

full_population %>% 
  dplyr::mutate_if(is.character, as.factor) %>%
  summary()

```

Our fitting problem only has 2639 rows in its reference sample. But once we replicate them, we will have 16870 rows which should closely matched our control totals, as shown by the output of `dim(full_population)`.
